This code directory is being retired to archive status on the 16th of March 2016. I am doing this because it has become unwieldy and I am having trouble keeping track of which pieces of code generated which panels in our paper manuscript. I am going to create a new wfly1_manuscript directory which will have a direct correspondence to the manuscript draft we are generating in March 2016. This draft incorporates changes suggested by lab members during our lab meeting discussion of the manuscript. At the time this note is being written we havent sent the paper out to external readers. This archive will allow us to access code as needed to generate any figures or run any analyses I have previously coded up. It will not however have a direct correspondence to the manuscript. I will rename figure directories within this archive to indicate the type of analyses the contents deal with.
